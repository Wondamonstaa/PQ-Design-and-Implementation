Implementation of Priority Queue using abstractions in C++

Queues process elements in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order.  But FIFO is not the best order for all problems.  For example, the problem of assisting patients in a hospital, in this case, you will want to service the patients who have the most critical injuries before others with less serious needs.  In this project, I created an abstraction class for a priority queue.
